**RogueTS** is a *TypeScript* port of  [F*Rogue][1] which is a Rogue like engine written I originally wrote in ActionScript. The F*Rogue engine features randomly generated maps, basic lighting effects, collision detection and stub code for building an inventory system. I am slowly porting over the rest of F*Rogue to RogueTS so stay tuned.
